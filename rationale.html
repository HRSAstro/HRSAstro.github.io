        We have reached a critical time for strong gravitational lensing research as forthcoming large-scale
        surveys (Euclid and the Vera Rubin Observatory) will map the entire sky and increase the number
        of known gravitational lenses from hundreds to tens of thousands. At the same time, imaging of
        strong gravitational lenses with current and forthcoming instruments (e.g. ALMA, JWST, E-ELT,
        SKA-VLBI) will spatially resolve scales that beyond the reach of telescopes for individual objects
        in the high-redshift Universe. These new data will revolutionise our understanding of dark matter,
        galaxy formation and evolution.</p>
      <p>
        The proposed symposium date of June 2023 is auspicious as it precedes the expected first data
        release from flagship survey facilities. The last major conference of the gravitational lensing com-
        munity will be more than seven years prior to the proposed date (GravLens 2016): since that time
        many new astronomers have entered the field, started groups and introduced fresh and innovative
        ideas. State-of-the-art techniques have been developed to resolve structure in the early Universe (e.g.
        Rizzo et al. 2020, Nature), test the nature of dark matter (e.g. Meneghetti et al. 2020, Science),
        test fundamental physics (e.g. Collett et al. 2018, Science) and efficiently analyse forthcoming big
        data sets (e.g. Hezaveh et al. 2017, Nature), demonstrating that the strong lensing community is
        well-placed to address key scientific questions in astrophysics.</p>
      <p>
        This strong gravitational lensing symposium will bring together observational and theoretical mem-
        bers of the community to review the progress of the field and outlook for the future. The goals of
        the symposium are
        <li>to understand the preparedness of the community to analyse and adapt to incoming big data;</li>
        <li>to assess the progress of the field in regard to precision lens modelling and modelling of high-
        angular-resolution data, and to understand what developments are needed;</li>
        <li>to find synergies between observations and simulations of dark matter and the high-redshift
        Universe;</li>
        <li>to determine the scientific questions that strong lensing will be posed to address over the next
        decade and foster collaboration.</li>
